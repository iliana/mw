=== Status command ===

`status` Will show whether a file has been locally modified ('M') or is clean ('C').

=== Pull command ===

The `pull` command has the following features:

* Can pull a new page/file, or update one.
* Can be provided a page name or file name.
* If the wiki has updates, it will pull those unless they conflict 
  with local changes. The user must then resolve/merge conflicts.
